<h2> Safe Places </h2>

Final project of the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack.

Safe places is a platform where people can share the experiences they have lived, in public or private places, due to their orientation or sexual identity.

It is meant to be a safe place itself where the LGTB community can freely communicate and find reviews of any kind of place.

Wether if youÂ´ve had a good or bad experience, sharing it with others will help them to find the right spot or avoid ugly situtatios.

Together, we make Safe places.
